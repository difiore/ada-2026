# Maximum Likelihood Estimation {#maximum-likelihood .unnumbered}

## Objectives {.unnumbered}

> This module provides a simple introduction to Maximum Likelihood Estimation.

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation** (MLE) is a method for estimating population parameters (such as the mean and variance for a normal distribution, the rate parameter (lambda) for a Poisson distribution, the regression coefficients for a linear model) from sample data such that the combined probability (likelihood) of obtaining the observed data is maximized. Here, we first explore the calculation of likelihood values generally and then use MLE to estimate the best parameters for defining from what particular normal distribution a set of data is most likely drawn.

## Probability Density Functions and Likelihoods

A **Probability Density Function** (PDF) is a function describing the density of a continuous random variable (a probability mass function, or PMF, is an analogous function for discrete random variables). The function's value can be calculated at any given point in the sample space (i.e., the range of possible values that the random variable might take) and provides the **relative likelihood** of obtaining that value on a draw from the given distribution.

The PDF for a normal distribution defined by the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ is...

$$f(x | \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}$$

Where:
- $\mu$ is the mean (or expected value) of the distribution
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution. 
- $\sigma$ the standard deviation. 
- $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)
- $\pi$ is a mathematical constant (approximately 3.14159) 

Solving this function for any value of $x$ yields the relative likelihood ($L$) of drawing that value from the distribution.

## Calculating Likelihoods

As an example, we can calculate the relative likelihood of drawing the number 45.6 out of a normal distribution with a mean ($\mu$) of 50 and a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of 10...

```{r}
val <- 45.6
mean <- 50
sd <- 10
(l <- 1/sqrt(2 * pi * sd^2) * exp((-(val - mean)^2)/(2 * sd^2)))
```

The `dnorm()` function returns this relative likelihood directly...

```{r} 
(l <- dnorm(val, mean, sd))
```

To further explore calculating likelihoods, let's create and plot a sample of 100 random variables from a normal distribution with a $\mu$ of 50 and a $\sigma$ of 10:

```{r}
d <- tibble(val = rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10))
p <- ggplot(d) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = val, y = after_stat(density)))
p
```

The mean and standard deviation of this sample are pretty are close to the parameters that we pass to the `rnorm()` function, even though (given the limited size of our sample) the distribution is not smooth...

```{r}
(mean <- mean(d$val))
(sd <- sd(d$val))
```

Now, on top of the histogram of our sample data, let's plot two different normal distributions, one with the distribution our sample was drawn from ($\mu$ = 50 and $\sigma$ = 10, in red) and another with a different $\mu$ (65) and $\sigma$ (20).

```{r}
p <- p +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 50, sd = 10), color = "red", linewidth = 1) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 65, sd = 20), color = "blue", linewidth = 1)
p
```

Based on the figure, it should be pretty clear that our observed sample (our set of 100 random draws) is **more likely** to have been drawn from the former distribution than the latter.

### CHALLENGE {.unnumbered}

What is the relative likelihood of seeing a value of 41 on a random draw from a normal distribution with $\mu$ = 50 and $\sigma$ = 10?

```{r}
val <- 41
mean <- 50
sd <- 10
# or
(l1 <- dnorm(val, mean, sd))
```

### CHALLENGE {.unnumbered}

What is the relative likelihood of seeing a value of 41 on a random draw from a normal distribution with $\mu$ = 65 and $\sigma$ = 20?

```{r}
val <- 41
mean <- 65
sd <- 10
(l2 <- dnorm(val, mean, sd))
```

Note the difference in these two likelihoods, **l1** and **l2**... there is a much higher likelhood of an observation of 41 coming from the first of the two normal distributions we considered. In this case, the **likelihood ratio** is **l1/l2**.

```{r}
l1/l2
```

We can also calculate the relative likelihood of drawing a particular set of observations from a given distribution as the product of the likelihoods of each observation as the probability of *n* independent events is simply the product ($∏$) of their independent probabilities. An easy way to calculate the product of a set of numbers is by taking the natural log of each number, summing those values, and then exponentiating the sum. For this reason, likelihood calculations are often operationalized in terms of *log likelihoods*.

For example, the following operations are equivalent...

```{r}
5 * 8 * 9 * 4
exp(log(5) + log(8) + log(9) + log(4))
exp(sum(log(c(5, 8, 9, 4))))
```

### CHALLENGE {.unnumbered}

What is the relative likelihood of drawing the set of three numbers 41, 70, and 10 from a normal distribution with $\mu$ = 50 and $\sigma$ = 10?

```{r}
val <- c(41, 70, 10)
mean <- 65
sd <- 10
(l <- dnorm(val, mean, sd)) # vector of likelihoods of each value
(l[1] * l[2] * l[3]) # product of likelihoods
(ll <- log(l)) # log likelihoods of each value
(ll <- sum(ll)) # summed log likelihood
(l <- exp(ll)) # convert back to likelihood
```

> NOTE: Likelihoods are always going to be zero or greater, but log likelihoods can be negative. A less negative log likelihood is nonetheless more likely than a more negative one.

### CHALLENGE {.unnumbered}

What are the log likelihood and likelihood of drawing the sample, *d*, we constructed above from a normal distribution with $\mu$ = 50 and $\sigma$ = 10? How do these compare to the log likelihood and likelihood of that same sample being drawn from a normal distribution with $\mu$ = 65 and $\sigma$ = 20?

```{r}
val <- d$val
mean <- 50
sd <- 10
l <- dnorm(val, mean, sd)
ll <- log(l)
ll <- sum(ll)
(l <- exp(ll)) # a very tiny number!

mean <- 65
sd <- 20
l <- dnorm(val, mean, sd)
ll <- log(l)
ll <- sum(ll)
(l <- exp(ll)) # an even tinier number
```

The log likelihood and likelihood are both HIGHER (more likely to have been drawn) from the first distribution.

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Now that we have an understanding of how likelihood calculations are done, we can consider the process of **maximum likelihood estimation** (MLE). MLE allows us to estimate what values of population parameters (e.g., $\mu$ and $\sigma$) are most likely *given* a dataset and a probability distribution function for the process generating the data (e.g., a Gaussian process).

First, let's create a function for calculating the **negative** log likelihood for a set of data under a particular normal distribution. To convert the log likelihood to a negative, we simply multiply it negative 1. The reason we do this is because most optimization algorithms function by searching for parameter values that yield the minimum negative log likelihood rather than the maximum likelihood directly.

```{r}
verbose_nll <- function(val, mu, sigma, verbose = FALSE) {
  l <- 0 # set initial likelihood to 0 to define variable
  ll <- 0 # set initial log likelihood to 0 to define variable
  for (i in 1:length(val)){
    l[[i]] = dnorm(val[[i]], mean = mu, sd = sigma) # likelihoods
    ll[[i]] <- log(l[[i]]) # log likelihoods
    if (verbose == TRUE) {
      message(paste0("x=", round(val[[i]], 4),
                     " mu=", mu,
                     " sigma=", sigma,
                     " L=", round(l[[i]], 4),
                     " logL=", round(ll[[i]],4)))
    }
  }
  nll <- -1 * sum(ll)
  return(nll)
}
```

Testing our function...

```{r}
# if we include verbose = TRUE as an argument to `verbose_nll`, the function will print each likelihood and log likelihood value before returning the summed negative log likelihood
val <- d$val
mean <- 50
sd <- 10
verbose_nll(val, mean, sd)
mean <- 65
sd <- 20
verbose_nll(val, mean, sd)
```

... we see that **negative log likelihood** of our data under the first distribution is smaller than under the second, indicating that it is more likely that are data are drawn from the first distribution.

To use maximum likelihood estimation, we need to create a simpler version of this function that does not have the data as argument, but rather only involves the parameter we want to estimate. The function below does this. Note that unlike the function above, this version does not use a loop and has the vector variable *val* included as the first argument to the `dnorm()` function. We also include the argument `log = TRUE` within the `dnorm()` function to calculate the log likelihood directly, instead of including that as an extra step.

```{r}
simple_nll <- function(mu, sigma, verbose = TRUE) {
  ll = sum(dnorm(val, mean = mu, sd = sigma, log = TRUE))
  nll <- -1 * ll
  return(nll)
}
```

Testing our function, we should get the same results as above...

```{r}
val <- d$val
mean <- 50
sd <- 10
simple_nll(mean, sd)

val <- d$val
mean <- 65
sd <- 20
simple_nll(mean, sd)
```

So far, we have just use this function to calculate the (negative) log likelihood of our data being generated by a Gaussian (normal) process with specific $\mu$ and $\sigma$ parameters... but what we really want to do is estimate values for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that have highest likelihood for generating our data. To do this, we will use the `mle2()` function from the {bbmle} package. This function takes the following arguments...

- **minuslogl**, which is a user-defined function for generating negative log likelihoods... this is what we created above
- **start**, which is a list of initial values for the parameters we want estimate
- **method**, which is the particular algorithm used for optimization of the parameter estimates (`mle2()` and the `optim()` function, which it calls, are highly customizable)

> NOTE: Be aware that to run the function below, we need to have the variable **val**, a vector of values, specified outside of the function. We previously set **val** to **d**, our random sample of 100 draws from a normal distribution with $\mu$=50 and $\sigma$=10... feel free to play around with alternatives and see how well the MLE process estimates these parameters.

```{r}
val <- rnorm(1000, mean = 50, sd = 10)
mle_norm <- mle2(
  minuslogl = simple_nll,
  start  = list(mu = 0, sigma = 1),
  method = "SANN" # simulated annealing method of optimization, one of several options
)
# note that we may sometimes see a warning about NaNs being produced... this is okay!
mle_norm
# note the estimates for `mu` and `sigma` are very close to the population level parameters of the normal distribution that our vector `val` was drawn from
```

An alternative for MLE is the `maxLik()` function from the {maxLik} package. To use function, we again first define our own log likelihood function, but this time we do not want an negative log likelihood, so we do not multiply it by minus 1. This is because the first argument to `maxLik()` is a log likelihood function, not a **negtive** log likelihood function. Our function should also have only one argument... a **vector** of parameter values... rather than separate arguments for each parameter.

```{r}
simple_ll <- function(parameters) {
  # `parameters` is a vector of parameter values
  mu <- parameters[1]
  sigma <- parameters[2]
  ll = sum(dnorm(val, mean = mu, sd = sigma, log = TRUE))
  return(ll)
}

# test...
simple_ll(c(50, 10)) # this should be very close to the log likelihood returned above

# an alternative function
simple_ll <- function(parameters) {
  mu <- parameters[1]
  sigma <- parameters[2]
  N <- length(val)
  ll <- -1 * N * log(sqrt(2*pi)) - N*log(sigma) - 0.5*sum((val - mu)^2/sigma^2)
  return(ll)
}

# test...
simple_ll(c(50, 10))
```

As for `mle2()`, for `maxLik()` we need to specify several arguments:

- **logLik**, which is our user-defined function for generating log likelihoods (**not** negative log likelihoods)
- **start**, which is a named vector of initial values for the parameters we want estimate
- **method**, which is the particular algorithm used for optimization of the parameter estimates

```{r}
mle_norm <- maxLik(logLik = simple_ll, start=c(mu=0, sigma=1), method = "NM")
summary(mle_norm)
```

The results should be very comparable to those generated using `mle2()`.

## MLE for Simple Linear Regression

Now let's work through an example of using MLE for simple linear regression. Load in our zombie apocalypse survivors dataset...

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/zombies.csv"
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)

# Standard OLS linear regression model with our zombie apocalypse survivor dataset
m <- lm(data = d, height ~ weight)
summary(m)

# Compare to...
# Likelihood based linear regression with `mle2()`... now we likelihood function that has three instead of two parameters: b0, b1, and sigma, or the standard deviation in (presumably normally distributed!) residuals...
simple_nll <- function(b0, b1, sigma, verbose = TRUE) {
  # here, we say how our expectation for how our response variable, y, is calculated based on parameters
  y <- b0 + b1 * d$weight 
  N <- nrow(d)
  ll <- -1 * N*log(sqrt(2*pi)) - N*log(sigma) - 0.5*sum((d$height - y)^2/sigma^2)
  nll <- -1 * ll
  return(nll)
}

mle_norm <- mle2(
  minuslogl = simple_nll,
  start  = list(b0=10, b1=0, sigma=1), 
  method = "Nelder-Mead" # implements the Nelder-Mead algorithm for likelihood maximization
)
mle_norm
summary(mle_norm)

# Compare to...
# Likelihood based linear regression with `maxLik()`
loglik <- function(parameters) {
  b0 <- parameters[1]
  b1 <- parameters[2]
  sigma <- parameters[3]
  N <- nrow(d)
  # here, we say how our expectation for how our response variable, y, is calculated based on parameters
  y <- b0 + b1 * d$weight # estimating mean height as a function of weight
  # then use this mu in a similar fashion as previously
  ll <- -1 * N*log(sqrt(2*pi)) - N*log(sigma) - 0.5*sum((d$height - y)^2/sigma^2)
  return(ll)
}

mle_norm <- maxLik(loglik,
                   start=c(beta0=0, beta1=0, sigma=1),
                   method = "NM") # implements the Nelder-Mead algorithm for likelihood maximization
summary(mle_norm)

# results of both of these should be similar!
```
