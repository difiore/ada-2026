# Using ***Python*** from ***R*** {#using-python .unnumbered}

## Objectives {.unnumbered}

> In this module, we look at how to integrate ***Python*** code and functions into ***R***.

## Preliminaries {.unnumbered}

- Install and load this package in ***R***: [{reticulate}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reticulate/reticulate.pdf)
- Load {tidyverse} and {broom}
- Make sure you have a working ***Python*** installation on your computer *and* a package manager for ***Python***

```{r}
#| include: false
#| message: false
library(reticulate)
```

> **NOTE:** Recent versions of the MacOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems typically include a ***Python*** installation by default, but that may not be an up-to-date version and the included package manager may not be comprehensive. Thus, for most users, it is worthwhile to download and install an updated version of ***Python*** along with a software system for managing ***Python*** libraries and environments.

[***Anaconda***](https://www.anaconda.com/download) is one such such system; it is a comprehensive, open-source distribution for ***Python*** (as well as other scientific computing software, including ***R***, and ***RStudio***, and ***Jupyter*** notebooks), and it provides an easy way to get an up-to-date version of ***Python*** installed. Binary ***Anaconda*** installers are available for most computer operating systems, including MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Running the installer basically installs a command-line package manager, ***conda***, for all of these different pieces of software, as well as a graphical version of that manager and software launcher, named ***Anaconda-Navigator***. Unless you specify otherwise, the current distribution of ***Anaconda*** should install (on MacOS) to a directory called `/opt/anaconda3` if you installed for all users or to `~/anaconda3` at the root of your user folder if you installed for just youself.

Alternatively, you can install a pared-down version of ***Anaconda*** called [***Miniconda***](https://www.anaconda.com/download), which consists of just the ***conda*** package manager, ***Python***, and a limited set of additional packages. You can download and install ***Miniconda*** yourself from this URL, in which case it should install to this directory on MacOS: `~/miniconda3`.

Alternatively, you could also download and install ***Miniconda*** from within {reticulate}. In fact, when you first run a function from `library(reticulate)`, you may see a prompt asking if you want to install ***Miniconda***...

````
No non-system installation of Python could be found.
Would you like to download and install Miniconda?
Miniconda is an open source environment management system for Python.
See https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html for more details.
````

If so, you can answer "Y" and let the installation run. In doing so, the installer will create a directory at the base of your user folder called `~/Library/r-miniconda-XXX` (where "XXX" indicates the kind of processor your computer has, e.g., "arm64") with a **conda** installation in it.

If you are not prompted to install ***Miniconda***, you can install it manually using the {reticulate} command `install_miniconda()`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install_miniconda()
```

This process using {reticulate} installs ***Miniconda*** to a different location than installing the download from the ***Anaconda*** webpage also does not add PATH configuration lines to your shell script. Thus, if you choose this route for ***Miniconda*** installation, it may be less easy to use the terminal to run **conda** commands as you would then need to manually configure your PATH.

> **NOTE**: There is no need to install both ***Anaconda*** and ***Miniconda***... choose one or the other! Both will write a series of PATH configuration lines to your shell profile, and, if you do install both, the latter one to be installed will overwrite the PATH details of the former in your default shell profile.

## Background {.unnumbered}

One of the wonderful things about ***R*** is that it offers interoperability with several other programming languages useful for statistical analysis, data science, and data visualization, including ***Python***, ***Stan***, ***Julia***, ***JavaScript***, and ***C++***. Here, we explore the {reticulate} package, which essentially embeds a ***Python*** session within your ***R*** session, allowing you the opportunity to smoothly integrate ***Python*** code into ***R*** workflows and analyses through the ***RStudio*** IDE. For additional details, see the information on the {reticulate} package's website [R Interface to ***Python***](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) website.

With {reticulate}, we can call ***Python*** code from ***R*** in several ways:

- By including ***Python*** code chunks within a **Quarto** or **R Markdown** document
- By importing ***Python*** modules into ***R*** and accessing their functions
- By sourcing entire ***Python*** scripts (".py" files)
- By using ***Python*** interactively within an ***R*** session

We can also use {reticulate} to convert between ***R*** and ***Python*** objects (e.g., between ***R*** and ***Python*** {pandas} data frames).

## Getting Started with {reticulate} {.unnumbered}

### Configuring ***Python*** {.unnumbered}

Many computers may have several different versions of ***Python*** installed in different places. Upon loading {reticulate} and first calling the ***Python*** function `import`, either directly or implicitly , ***R*** tries to find and "attach" to one of these versions. To control the process, it is recommended that you specify or build a desired ***Python*** version and then pass this suggested instance to {reticulate}. Restarting ***R*** will unbind an instance and allow you to specify a different one.

The ***R*** commands `Sys.which("python")` and `Sys.which("python3")` will return the path to the current version of ***Python*** (for pre-version 3 installations) and ***Python3***, respectively, that ***R*** has bound. Unless you specify a ***Python*** instance from a particular "environment" or via the *Preferences* or *Global Options* dialog boxes (see below), these will usually be "/usr/bin/python" and "/usr/bin/python3" or "/usr/local/bin/python" and "/usr/local/bin/python3". [Sometimes, the path returned by these functions is actually a *symlink*, a kind of pointer, to the actual executable file.] If you have a version of **Python** from an ***Anaconda*** installation specified, these will usually be "/opt/anaconda3/bin/python" and "/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3", as noted above.

> **NOTE**: If your computer does not have an older, pre-3.0 version of ***Python*** installed, `Sys.which("python")` may return a blank path or the path to a 3.x version of ***Python***.

```{r}
#| eval: false
Sys.which("python")
Sys.which("python3")
```

After loading {reticulate}, if you run the function `py_config()`, it will return information on the version of and path to the ***Python*** binary (executable program) and associated libraries that {reticulate} is currently bound to, It also returns the version and location of {numpy}, an important ***Python*** library for maths, if it is installed.

```{r}
py_config()
```

You can specify or change the version of ***Python*** that {reticulate} uses via the ***RStudio*** IDE by going either the *Preferences* (MacOS) or *Global Options* (MacOS or PC) dialog box and selecting the *Python* section...

```{r}
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/python.png")
```

```{r}
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/python-details.png")
```

... and then choosing the desired ***Python*** interpreter from the dialog boxes. ***RStudio*** will try to list all available ***Python*** interpreters for you, either ones installed in the system (e.g., distributed with MacOS) or ones associated with different virtual or conda "environments" (see below) that you have created. You can also type the path to the version of the ***Python*** interpreter you wish to using directly into the dialog box. After you click, "Apply" you will be prompted to restart ***R*** to allow {reticulate} be able to rebind to a different interpreter.

```{r}
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/interpreter.png")
```

After ***R*** restarts, reload {reticulate}, then call `py_config()` to verify that {reticulate} is connected to the desired ***Python*** executable.

> **NOTE:** After changing the bound version of ***Python*** in this manner and running py_config(), the last line of the output should read as follows:

````
NOTE: Python version was forced by use_python() function
````

Be aware that specification of the ***Python*** interpreter in this manner is "sticky". That is, if an interpreter is specified in *Global Options*, then that takes precedence over assigning an interpreter with `use_python()` or by assigning an environment (see below). If you specify a version of ***Python*** to use in *Global Options*, you will not be able change to a different interpreter or specify what environment to use via code.

If we do not use *Global Options* or *Preferences* to specify an interpreter, we can instead directly suggest what ***Python*** interpreter that {reticulate} should use from ***R*** by calling the `use_python()` function with the path to the interpreter as an argument. For example, as noted above, the current ***Anaconda*** distribution typically installs its own versions of ***Python*** in "/opt/anaconda3/bin/", thus we could specify that we want {reticulate} to bind to that version as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
use_python("/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3", required=TRUE)
py_config() # confirm our selection
```

Similarly, as described above, the ***Miniconda*** version of the **conda** package manager installed from within {reticulate} places its version of ***Python*** inside a user's `Library` directory, e.g., at
"~/Library/r-miniconda3-arm64/bin/python". We can set {reticulate} to bind that version using the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
use_python("~/Library/r-miniconda-arm64/bin/python3", required = TRUE)
py_config() # confirm our selection
```

It is important to remember that if you want to modify the particular instance of ***Python*** that {reticulate} should to attach to, it is necessary to first RESTART ***R***, which you can do either in ***RStudio*** (by choosing that option from the **Session** menu) or by using the function `.rs.restartR()` at a command prompt), then load {reticulate} again, and then run the `use_python()` function. After doing this, you can run `py_config()` again to confirm that the ***Python*** configuration has indeed changed as desired, and you can check with `Sys.which("python")` or `Sys.which("python3")` to confirm what instance of ***Python*** is attached. For example...

```{r}
#| eval: false
.rs.restartR()
library(reticulate)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
use_python("~/Library/r-miniconda-arm64/bin/python3", required = TRUE)
py_config() # confirm our selection
Sys.which("python3")
```

> **NOTE:** After changing the bound version of ***Python*** in this manner and running py_config(), the last line of the output should read as follows:

````
NOTE: Python version was forced by use_python function
````

Note that changing the intepreter this way is **not** "sticky." That is, if you were to restart ***R*** again, load {reticulate}, and run `py_config()` without specifying a configuration using `use_python()`, {reticulate} will scan along your PATH and other possible places where ***Python*** might be installed to find the first appropriate instance, giving preference to one where {numpy} is present as that library is very important for integrating ***Python*** and ***R***. Importantly, this may find a version of ***Python*** not associated with any particular "environment" (see below).

### Working with Environments {.unnumbered}

Whenever we work with ***Python***, it is best to do so in the context of an "environment". An **environment** (such as the "r-reticulate" environment created by default by installing ***Miniconda***) is basically a folder that contains all the necessary executables and ***Python*** **modules** (which are akin to ***R*** packages) that a particular ***Python*** project needs. An environment is kind of analogous to a repository containing an **R Project**, except that in ***R Projects***, the ***R*** executable and all of the packages used in a project are not physically replicated in each repository the way that a ***Python*** executable and referenced modules are (often) replicated within the environment. When we install any specific module that we want to are going to use in a script, we typically install it to a specific working environment.

Using environments is a way of isolating and keeping different versions of modules independent so as not to "break" our code when modules are updated. They also allow us to experiment with different ***Python*** setups.

***Python*** and {reticulate} support two different types of environments, **conda** environments, which are managed by **conda** and "virtual environments". We will focus first on **conda** environments.

#### **conda** Environments {.unnumbered}

The {reticulate} function `conda_list()` can be used to list all of the different **conda** environments that are registered within **conda** installations on your computer, along with the path to the ***Python*** binary associated with the environment.

> **NOTE**: Sometimes the path returned by `conda_list()` is a *symlink* to the actual executable file. That is, the *symlink* is located in the environment folder while the actual executable file resides in a different folder like `/usr/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin`.

```{r}
conda_list()
```

After running this command, you should see two or three environments listed, depending on whether you installed ***Anaconda***, ***Miniconda*** through {reticulate}, or both (and if you have set up other environments, you should see those listed as well). Installing ***Anaconda*** should have created an environment called "anaconda3" by default, while installing ***Miniconda*** through {reticulate} should have created two environments, one called "base" and one called "r-reticulate".

You can set up other new environments by running the function `conda_create()` and specifying a different environment name as an argument.

> **NOTE:** By default, if no environments have yet been defined, the `conda_create()` function creates one named "r-reticulate". This is what the ***Miniconda*** installer ran behind the scenes to create the default "r-reticulate" environment. But we can also provide an alternative name within the particular active **conda** installation.

When you create a new environment with `conda_create()`, it will be set up inside of the `envs/` directory in which our **conda** installation resides (again, if using ***Miniconda***, this should be within the `~/Library/r-miniconda-XXX/` directory. Environments created with `conda_create()` will include a default suite of ***Python*** packages that {reticulate} will have access to. They will also be associated with the particular instance of ***Python*** that is currently bound to {reticulate}, unless we specify otherwise using the "python_version =" argument within the `conda_create()` function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# create a new **conda** environment named "my-environment" that uses Python version 3.9...
conda_create("my-environment", python_version = 3.9)
conda_list()
```

The {reticulate} function `conda_remove()` can be used delete a particular **conda** environment when you no longer need it.

```{r}
#| eval: false
conda_remove("my-environment")
conda_list()
```

### Specifying an Environment {.unnumbered}

If we have more than one **conda** environment set up on our machines, perhaps with different ***Python*** modules installed and/or using different versions of ***Python***, we can use the functions `use_miniconda(condaenv =)` or `use_condaenv(condaenv =)` to "activate" a particular environment, i.e., to specify which one you want to bind to a particular ***R*** and {reticulate} session. [The "r-reticulate" environment set up by ***Miniconda***, if present, is the one that will be used by default if no other environment is specified.] Given that each environment contains a ***Python*** executable (or path to an executable), this is an alternative to `use_python()` as a way of also specifying a ***Python*** version for a particular project. Specifying an environment to use is analogous to opening a particular ***R Project*** from a repository.

As for `use_python()`, the way to force use of a non-default environment is to restart ***R***, load {reticulate}, and run the function `use_miniconda()` (or, equivalently, `use_condaenv()`) as below, after which running `py_config()` should confirm the configuration.

```{r}
#| eval: false
.rs.restartR()
library(reticulate)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
use_miniconda(condaenv = "r-reticulate", required = TRUE)
# or use_condaenv(condaenv = "r-reticulate", required = TRUE)
py_config()
Sys.which("python3")
```

> **NOTE:** It is a good idea to include the argument `required = TRUE`, which ensures that an error will be thrown if the specified environment is not found.

It is possible to also run all of these **conda** functions at the command prompt in a terminal...

````
# to list your conda environments and show which one is active
$ conda info --envs

# OR
$ conda env list
````

> **NOTE:** Doing this from the command line shows an asterisk next to an environment called "base" that is a default environment that was created when we first installed ***Anaconda*** (as opposed to ***Miniconda***) and is associated with your base **conda** installation. This is typically at the path: "/opt/anaconda3" in current ***Anaconda*** installations.

````
# to create a conda environment
$ conda create --name my-environment

# to create a conda environment with a specific version of Python
# this will install an executable for the specified version
# of Python within the environment
$ conda create --name my-environment python=3.9

# to activate an environment
$ conda activate my-environment
````

> **NOTE:** Running `conda env list` after activating a different environment shows the asterisk next to the newly activated environment.

````
# to list the packages in the active environment
$ conda list

# to deactivate an active environment and return to *base*
$ conda deactivate

# to remove an environment
$ conda remove --name my-environment --all
````

> **NOTE:** An active environment needs to be deactivated before it can be removed.

The [**conda** documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) provides further details on how to use the **conda** package and environment management system that is central to the ***Anaconda*** and ***Miniconda*** distributions.

#### "Virtual" Environments {.unnumbered}

As noted above, {reticulate} actually supports using two different ***Python*** environment flavors: "**conda**" environments (as we set up above) and "virtual" environments. The former are stored inside of a directory called `envs/` that sits within a particular **conda** installation. The latter type of environments are typically stored in a hidden directory called `.virtualenvs/` at the root of your user folder.

To create and use "virtual" rather than **conda** environments with {reticulate}, the commands are very similar. Unless otherwise specified, the environment created will be bound to the ***Python*** interpreter associated with the current {reticulate} and ***R*** session.

```{r}
#| eval: false
virtualenv_create(envname = "r-reticulate")
virtualenv_create(envname = "my-environment")
virtualenv_list()
virtualenv_remove(envname = "my-environment")
use_virtualenv(virtualenv = "r-reticulate")
```

Once we have bound {reticulate} to a particular **conda** or "virtual" environment, we can check/confirm how our setup is configured by running `py_config()`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
py_config()
```

### Adding ***Python*** Modules {#adding-modules .unnumbered}

The {reticulate} package includes the simple function `py_install()` that can be used to install one or more ***Python*** modules into a specified environment (either a **conda** environment, as we created above, or a "virtual environment" if we are using that flavor of environment instead). With `py_install()`, new modules, by default, will be installed into the environment named "r-reticulate" (though this can be changed by specifying the "envname=" argument).

> **NOTE:** Alternatively, the function `conda_install(envname, packages)` will install python modules into a particular, specified **conda** environment, and the function `virtualenv_install(envname, packages)` will install packages into into a particular virtual environment, but `py_install()` is sufficient for our purposes.

Below, we install the python modules {scipy}, {numpy}, {pandas}, {matplotlib}, and {seaborn}, which are used in the subsequent ***Python*** coding examples, into the "r-reticulate" ***Miniconda*** environment.

> **NOTE:** In the function below, the `envname =` argument does not need to specified, but I have included it anyway.

```{r}
p <- c(
    "numpy",
    "scipy",
    "pandas",
    "matplotlib",
    "seaborn",
    "statsmodels"
  )
py_install(envname = "r-reticulate", packages = p)
# or conda_install(envname = "r-reticulate",  packages = p)
# or virtualenv_install(envname = "r-reticulate", packages = p, required = TRUE)
```

You can also use standard shell installation utilities at a terminal prompt (e.g., `conda` or `pip`) to activate an environment and to install ***Python*** modules.

````
# to activate an environment...
$ conda activate r-reticulate

# to install a module into an active conda environment...
$ conda install scipy

# or to install into a different, named environment, e.g., r-reticulate
$ conda install --name r-reticulate scipy

# to install a module into system level Python (i.e., globally, instead of in a specified environment)
$ sudo pip install scipy
````

## Using ***Python*** Code in ***R*** {#python-code .unnumbered}

As mentioned in the introduction above, there are multiple ways to integrate ***Python*** code into your ***R*** projects and workflow. You can...

- Include ***Python*** code chunks in **R Markdown** documents

    **R Markdown** now includes a language engine that supports bi-directional communication between ***R*** and Python (***R*** chunks can access Python objects and vice-versa).

- Import ***Python*** modules to access their functions directly from ***R***

    The `import()` function from {reticulate} enables you to import any Python module and call its functions directly from R.

- Source a ***Python*** script from ***R***

    The `source_python()` function from {reticulate} enables you to source a Python script the same way you would `source()` an ***R*** script. Python functions and objects defined within the script become directly available to the ***R*** session.

- Use a ***Python*** REPL ("Read-Eval-Print Loop")

    The `repl_python()` function embeds an interactive Python console within ***R*** that you can use interactively, as you would the ***R*** console. Objects you create within Python are available to your ***R*** session, and vice-versa.

More detail on each of these approaches, and examples, are given below.

### ***Python*** Code Chunks {.unnumbered}

The following example shows how ***Python*** code chunks can be included in ."qmd" or ".Rmd" documents. Note that we simply specify that the chunk type is `{python}` not `{r}`!

Using ***Python***, this code chunk imports the zombie apocalypse survivors datafile from **GitHub**, shows the first several lines of the dataset, and plots both a linear model of height~age and a boxplot of height~gender. 

````
```{{python}}
# this is a Python code chunk
import pandas
import seaborn
import matplotlib
f = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/zombies.csv"
z = pandas.read_csv(f)
print(z.head())
z = z[['gender', 'height', 'weight', 'age', 'major']]
# create a plot using the python seaborn module
p = seaborn.pairplot(
  data = z,
  hue = 'gender',
  kind = 'scatter',
  plot_kws = dict(alpha = 0.2)
)
# plot the active plot object
matplotlib.pyplot.show(p)
matplotlib.pyplot.clf()
p = seaborn.boxplot(x="gender", y="height", data=z)
# plot the active plot object
matplotlib.pyplot.show(p)
```
````

```{python}
#| echo: false
# this is a Python code chunk
import pandas
import seaborn
import matplotlib
f = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/zombies.csv"
z = pandas.read_csv(f)
print(z.head())
z = z[['gender', 'height', 'weight', 'age', 'major']]
# create a plot using the python seaborn module
p = seaborn.pairplot(
  data = z,
  hue = 'gender',
  kind = 'scatter',
  plot_kws = dict(alpha = 0.2)
)
# plot the active plot object
matplotlib.pyplot.show(p)
matplotlib.pyplot.clf()
p = seaborn.boxplot(x="gender", y="height", data=z)
# plot the active plot object
matplotlib.pyplot.show(p)
```

### Importing and Using Modules {.unnumbered}

Running the `import()` command in a code chunk in ***R*** will load functions and other data from within ***Python*** modules and classes directly into ***R***. The functions and data included in the ***Python*** module can then be accessed via the `$` operator, analogous to the way they would when we interact with an ***R*** object.

Imported ***Python*** modules also support code completion and inline help, again paralleling what we see with ***R*** packages.

```{r}
pandas <- import("pandas")
seaborn <- import("seaborn")
matplotlib <- import("matplotlib")
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/zombies.csv"
z <- pandas$read_csv(f)
head(z)
# now create a plot in R using the Python {seaborn} module
p <- seaborn$lmplot(x = 'age', y = 'height', data = z)
```

Because there is sometimes some awkwardness with using the {matplotlib} ***Python*** module from within ***R***, we can switch back to a {python} chunk to print out the figure created...

````
```{{python}}
import matplotlib
# plot the active plot object created with the R code above
matplotlib.pyplot.show(p)
```
````

```{python}
#| echo: false
import matplotlib
# plot the active plot object created with the R code above
matplotlib.pyplot.show(p)
```

### Sourcing a ***Python*** Script {.unnumbered}

We can use the `source_python()` function in ***R*** to source a ***Python*** script the same way we would source() an ***R*** script. We give the function the path to the file to load in and run as an argument. This process assumes the ".py" script is stored in a directory called `src/` located in the current working directory. The script loads in the zombie apocalypse survivors dataset from **GitHub** and then plots a boxplot of weight~gender.

```{r}
f <- "python_script.py"
source_python(paste0(getwd(),"/src/",f))
```

As above, we switch to a {python} chunk to print out the figures created...

````
```{{python}}
import matplotlib
# plot the active plot object created with the sourced python code
matplotlib.pyplot.show(p)
```
````

```{python}
#| echo: false
import matplotlib
# plot the active plot object created with the sourced python code
matplotlib.pyplot.show(p)
```

### Using ***Python*** Interactively {.unnumbered}

Finally, if you want to work with ***Python*** interactively, you can call the `repl_python()` function from ***R***, which provides a ***Python*** REPL ("Read--Eval--Print Loop") session embedded within your ***R*** session.

```{r}
#| eval: false
repl_python()
```

To test this out, copy and paste each of the following lines singly at the ***Python*** console prompt (`>>>`).

````
import pandas
import seaborn
import matplotlib
f = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ADA-datasets/master/zombies.csv"
z = pandas.read_csv(f)
print(z.head())
seaborn.lmplot(x="weight", y="height", data=z)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
exit()
````

## Converting Data Objects {.unnumbered}

One of the great things about {reticulate} allows us to share variables and states of ***Python*** objects across ***Python*** code chunks within the same **R Markdown** document, the same way we can with ***R*** code chunks.

It also allows us to access objects created within ***Python*** code chunks from ***R*** using the `py` object (e.g., we can use `py$age` would access a variable, **age** created within ***Python*** from ***R***).

Likewise, {reticulate} allows us to access objects created within ***R*** chunks from ***Python*** using the `r` object (e.g., we could use `r.sex` to access a variable named **sex** that was created within ***R*** from inside a ***Python*** code chunk).

{reticulate} supports built-in conversion between ***Python*** and ***R*** for many ***Python*** objects, including {numpy} arrays and {pandas} data frames.

**EXAMPLE:**

Here, we run a {python} chunk and load in a familiar data file from over the web...

````
```{{python}}
import pandas
f = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/woollydata.csv"
d = pandas.read_csv(f)
print(d.head())
```
````

```{python}
