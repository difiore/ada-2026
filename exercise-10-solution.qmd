# Exercise 10 Solution {.unnumbered}

# • Solution {.unnumbered}

- Using the {tidyverse} `read_csv()` function, load the "AVONETdataset1.csv" dataset as a "tibble" named **d**.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(cowplot)
library(broom)
library(infer)
library(mosaic)
library(ggpubr) # for ggqqplot()

f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/AVONETdataset1.csv"
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
```

- Winnow the dataset to variables of interest.

```{r}
d <- d |> select(Species1, Family1, Order1,
                 Beak.Length_Culmen, Beak.Width, Beak.Depth,
                 Tarsus.Length, Wing.Length, Tail.Length, Mass,
                  Habitat, Migration, Trophic.Level, Trophic.Niche,
                 Min.Latitude, Max.Latitude, Centroid.Latitude, Range.Size,
                 Primary.Lifestyle)
```

- Do a bit of exploratory data analysis.

```{r}
skim(d)
```

The taxomic variables, along with **Habitat**, **Trophic.Level**, **Trophic.Niche**, and **Migration**, are categorical, although **Migration** is scored using integer factors as "1", "2", or "3". The remaining variables are numeric.

## Challenge 1 {.unnumbered}

### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- Make boxplots of log(**Mass**) in relation to **Trophic.Level** and **Migration** and convert the variable **Migration** into a factor.

```{r}
d <- d |> mutate(
  logMass = log(Mass),
  logRS = log(Range.Size),
  logBeak = log(Beak.Length_Culmen),
  logTarsus = log(Tarsus.Length),
  Migration = as.factor(Migration))

p1 <- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Trophic.Level), aes(x = Trophic.Level, y = log(Mass))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05)

p2 <- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Migration) , aes(x = Migration, y = log(Mass))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05)
plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- Run linear models using the `lm()` function to look at the relationship between log(**Mass**) and **Trophic.Level** and between log(**Mass**) and **Migration**.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(logMass ~ Trophic.Level, data = d)
m2 <- lm(logMass ~ Migration, data = d)
```

- Examine the output of the resultant linear models. Is log(**Mass**) associated with either **Trophic.Level** or **Migration** category? That is, in the global test of significance, is the F statistic large enough to reject the null hypothesis of an F value of zero?

```{r}
summary(m1)
summary(m2)
```

In both cases, the global test is significant.

- Given the regression coefficients returned for your **Migration** model, which **Migration** categor(ies) are different than the reference level? What level is the reference level?

In m2, **Migration** levels 2 and 3 are both different from **Migration** level 1, which is the reference level.

- Relevel and assess differences among the remaining pair of **Migration** categories.

```{r}
d <- d |> mutate(Migration = relevel(Migration, ref = "3"))
m2 <- lm(logMass ~ Migration, data = d)
summary(m2)
```

Based on the re-leveled model results, **Migration** levels 2 and 3 are also different from one another.

### Step 3 {.unnumbered}

- Conduct a post-hoc Tukey Significant Differences test to also evaluate which **Migration** categories differ "significantly" from one another.

```{r}
# we need an ANOVA object to run a Tukey test
m2 <- aov(logMass ~ Migration, data = d)
(posthoc <- TukeyHSD(m2, which = "Migration", conf.level = 0.95))
plot(posthoc)
```

Comparisons among all pairs of levels are significant.

### Step 4 {.unnumbered}

- Use a permutation approach to inference to generate a null distribution of F statistic values for the model of log(**Mass**) in relation to **Trophic.Level** and calculate a p value for your original F statistic.

```{r}
#| warning: false
original.F <- aov(logMass ~ Trophic.Level, data = d) |>
  tidy() |>
  filter(term == "Trophic.Level") |>
  pull(statistic)
# show aov results for F statistic and p value for omnibus F test
original.F

# using {infer}
permuted.F <- d |>
  specify(logMass ~ Trophic.Level) |>
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") |>
  calculate(stat = "F")

visualize(permuted.F) + shade_p_value(obs_stat = original.F, direction = "greater")

p.value <- permuted.F |>
  get_p_value(obs_stat = original.F, direction = "greater")

# or...
# using {mosaic}
reps <- 1000
permuted.F <- do(reps) * {
  d |>
    mutate(Trophic.Level = sample(Trophic.Level)) %>%
    # note the use of the %>% pipe operator in the line above... for some reason, the native pipe operator (`|>`) throws an error!
    aov(logMass ~ Trophic.Level, data = .) |>
    tidy() |>
    filter(term == "Trophic.Level") |>
    pull(statistic)
}

permuted.F <- as_tibble(permuted.F) |>
  rename(stat = "result")

p.value <- permuted.F |>
  get_p_value(obs_stat = original.F, direction = "greater")
p.value
```

## Challenge 2 {.unnumbered}

### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- Create the following two new variables and add them to AVONET dataset:
  - **Relative beak length**, which you should calculate as the *residual* of log(**Beak.Length_Culmen**) on log(**Mass**).
  - **Relative tarsus length**, which you should calculate as the *residual* of log(**Tarsus.Length**) on log(**Mass**).

```{r}
relBeak <- lm(logBeak ~ logMass, data = d)
relTarsus <- lm(logTarsus ~ logMass, data = d)
d <- d |> mutate(
  relBeak = relBeak$residuals,
  relTarsus = relTarsus$residuals)
```

### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- Make a boxplot or violin plot of your new relative tarsus length variable in relation to **Primary.Lifestyle** and of your new relative beak length variable in relation to **Trophic.Niche**

```{r}
d <- d |> mutate(
  Primary.Lifestyle = factor(Primary.Lifestyle,
                             levels = c("Aerial", "Aquatic", "Insessorial",
                                        "Terrestrial", "Generalist"))
)
p1 <- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Primary.Lifestyle), aes(x=Primary.Lifestyle, y=relTarsus)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  #geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))

d <- d |> mutate(
  Trophic.Niche = factor(Trophic.Niche,
                         levels = c("Nectarivore", "Herbivore aquatic", "Frugivore",
                                    "Granivore", "Herbivore terrestrial",
                                    "Aquatic predator", "Invertivore", "Vertivore",
                                    "Scavenger", "Omnivore"))
)
p2 <- ggplot(data = d |> drop_na(Trophic.Niche), aes(x=Trophic.Niche, y=relBeak)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  # geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

### Step 3 {.unnumbered}

- Run ANOVA analyses to look at the association between geographic range size and the variable **Migration**. You should first drop those observations for which **Migration** is not scored and also look at the distribution of the variable **Range.Size** to decide whether and how it might need to be transformed.

```{r}
migration <- d |> drop_na(Migration)
histogram(migration$Range.Size)
histogram(migration$logRS)
```

It looks like **Range.Size** should be log transformed!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
# look at distribution of the data across levels
ggplot(data = migration, aes(x = Migration, y = logRS)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05, width = 0.5) 
```

```{r}
m3 <- lm(logRS ~ Migration, data = migration)
summary(m3)
```

- Based on the global model, is range size associated with form of migration? How much of the variance in your measure of range size is associated with **Migration** behavior level?

From the model `summary()`, we can see that the F statistic is significant, although the R-squared value suggests that only ~9% of the variation in log(range size) is associated with **Migration** behavior style.

> **NOTE:** We can calculate the amount of variance explained by the model (i.e., R-squared, or, a.k.a. $\eta$-squared) ourselves from the ANOVA table output from running `aov()`. To do so, we calculate the ratio of the *regression sum of squares* to the *total sum of squares*. The code below pulls these value from a `tidy()` table of the model coefficients...

```{r}
m3 <- aov(logRS ~ Migration, data = migration)
summary(m3)

coefs <- m3 |> tidy() %>% select(term, sumsq)
(r2 <- 1 - (coefs |> filter(term == "Residuals") |> pull(sumsq)) / (coefs |> summarize(totalSS = sum(sumsq)) |> pull(totalSS)))
```

- Given the regression coefficients returned in the output of the model, which **Migration** categor(ies) are different than the reference level? What level is the reference level?

In the `summary()` of the m3 linear model, **Migration** levels 1 and 2 are both different from **Migration** level 3, which is the reference level (because that is what we releveled to above).

- Re-level and assess differences among the remaining pair of **Migration** categories.

```{r}
migration <- migration |> mutate(Migration = relevel(Migration, ref = "1"))
m3 <- aov(logRS ~ Migration, data = migration)
summary(m3)
```

After re-leveling, we can see that **Migration** levels 1 and 2 are also different from one another.

- Also conduct a post-hoc Tukey Honest Significant Differences test to also evaluate which **Migration** categories differ "significantly" from one another.

```{r}
(posthoc <- TukeyHSD(m3, which = "Migration", conf.level = 0.95))
plot(posthoc)
```

### Step 4 {.unnumbered}

- Winnow your original data to just consider birds from the Infraorder "Passeriformes" (song birds).

```{r}
pass <- d |> filter(Order1 == "Passeriformes")
```

- Run separate one-factor ANOVA analyses to look at the association between [1] relative beak length and **Primary.Lifestyle** and between [2] relative beak length and **Trophic.Level**. In doing so...

Make boxplots of the response variable by each predictor and by the combination of predictors...

```{r}
#| fig-height: 12
p1 <- ggplot(data=pass, aes(x=Primary.Lifestyle, y=relBeak)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
p2 <- ggplot(data=pass, aes(x=Trophic.Level, y=relBeak)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
p3 <- ggplot(data = pass, aes(x=Primary.Lifestyle, y=relBeak)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  facet_wrap(~Trophic.Level) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
p4 <- ggplot(data = pass, aes(x=Trophic.Level, y=relBeak)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  facet_wrap(~Primary.Lifestyle) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
plot_grid(plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 1), p3, p4, nrow = 3)
```

... and run linear models for each predictor separately and interpret the model output.

```{r}
m5 <- aov(relBeak ~ Primary.Lifestyle, data = pass)
# or
# m5 <- lm(relBeak ~ Primary.Lifestyle, data = pass)
summary(m5)
```

```{r}
m6 <- aov(relBeak ~ Trophic.Level, data = pass)
# or
# m6 <- lm(relBeak ~ Trophic.Level, data = pass)
summary(m6)
```

Relative beak length is significantly associated with both variables, but the R-squared (or eta- squared) values are quite modest.

### Step 5 {.unnumbered}

- Run a two-factor model to look at the association between relative beak length and both **Primary.Lifestyle** and **Trophic.Level** among the passeriforms. Based on the model output, what would you conclude about how relative beak length is related to these two variables?

```{r}
m7 <- aov(relBeak ~ Primary.Lifestyle + Trophic.Level, data = pass)
# or
# m7 <- lm(relBeak ~ Primary.Lifestyle + Trophic.Level, data = pass)
summary(m7)
```

Both variables are important predictors of relative beak length.

### Step 6 {.unnumbered}

- Finally, run an additional two-way model with the same dataset and predictors, but adding the possibility of an interaction term. Based on the model output, what would you now conclude about how relative beak length is related to these two variables?

```{r}
m8 <- aov(relBeak ~ Primary.Lifestyle + Trophic.Level + Primary.Lifestyle:Trophic.Level, data = pass)
# or
# m8 <- lm(relBeak ~ Primary.Lifestyle + Trophic.Level + Primary.Lifestyle:Trophic.Level, data = pass)
# or
# m8 <- lm(relBeak ~ Primary.Lifestyle * Trophic.Level, data = pass)
summary(m8)
```

**Primary.Lifestyle**, **Trophic.Level**, and the interaction of these two variables are all significant predictors of relative beak length.

### Step 7 {.unnumbered}

- Use the `interaction.plot()` function to visualize the interaction between **Primary.Lifestyle** and **Trophic.Level**.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 8
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
interaction.plot(
  x.factor = pass$Primary.Lifestyle,
  xlab = "Primary Lifestyle",
  trace.factor = pass$Trophic.Level,
  trace.label = "Trophic Level",
  response = pass$relBeak,
  fun = base::mean, # make sure we use {base} version
  ylab = "Mean Relative Beak Length"
)

interaction.plot(
  x.factor = pass$Trophic.Level,
  xlab = "Trophic Level",
  trace.factor = pass$Primary.Lifestyle,
  trace.label = "Primary Lifestyle",
  response = pass$relBeak,
  fun = base::mean, # make sure we use {base} version
  ylab = "Mean Relative Beak Length"
)
```

## Step 8 {.unnumbered}

Let's look at the model of **relative beak size ~ trophic level**.

First, we check the ratio of variances among different levels of the predictor...

```{r}
sd_ratio <- pass |> group_by(Trophic.Level) |>
  summarize(sd = sd(relBeak, na.rm = TRUE)) |> pull(sd)
(sd_ratio <- max(sd_ratio) / min(sd_ratio))
```

Then, we do visual checks for normality of observations and residuals within groups... all seem to deviate from normality!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
p1 <- ggplot(data = pass, aes(x=relBeak)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~Trophic.Level)
m6data <- tibble(residuals = m6$residuals, Trophic.Level = m6$model$Trophic.Level)
p2 <- ggqqplot(data = m6data, x = "residuals") + facet_wrap(~Trophic.Level)
plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow=2)
```

We can do the same for our model of log(range size) ~ migration level.

Ratio of variances...

```{r}
sd_ratio <- migration |>
  group_by(Migration) |>
  summarize(sd = sd(logRS, na.rm = TRUE)) |> pull(sd)
(sd_ratio <- max(sd_ratio) / min(sd_ratio))
```

Visual checks... again all seem to deviate from normality!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
p1 <- ggplot(data = migration, aes(x=logRS)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~Migration)
m3data <- tibble(residuals = m3$residuals, Migration = m3$model$Migration)
p2 <- ggqqplot(data = m3data, x = "residuals") + facet_wrap(~Migration)
plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow=2)
```

Although the variance ratios are under 2, given the clear deviation from normality for the residuals, we are not **really** justified in using standard (or general) linear regression for the analyses done above.
