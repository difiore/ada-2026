# • Solution {.unnumbered}

Use the `Show Code` button to peek at one solution to each of the four functions. Note that needed libraries are specified with the `require()` at the top of each function. You could use `library()` as an alternative. You could also have these loaded in the global environment, but these would not be as "portable" across users and systems. Each of these functions includes some commented out `print()` and/or `glimpse()` statements that are useful for viewing intermediate values for debugging.

> **NOTE:** The `play_wordle()` and `evaluate_guess()` functions include an additional argument, "output_type", that lets the user specify whether they would like to see simple text output or formatted ("graphic") output, which is made possible by using the {huxtable} library. A substantial chunk of the `play_wordle()` and `evaluate_guess()` functions are devoted to producing this graphic output and are not necessary.
