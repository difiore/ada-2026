# Exercise 02 {.unnumbered}

# Practice Reproducible Research Workflows {.unnumbered}

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Integrating an ***RStudio*** project, a local ***git*** repository, and a **GitHub** remote repository

## Task 1: Begin with a remote repo... {.unnumbered}

Follow the instructions outlined as **Method 1** in [**Module 6**](#module-06) to do the following:

#### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- Set up a new ***GitHub*** repo in your ***GitHub*** workspace named "exercise-02a".

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/exercise-2a.png")
```

#### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- Add me as a collaborator on the repo by going to "Settings", choosing "Collaborators", then "Add People", and searching for my ***GitHub*** username (“difiore”).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/settings.png")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/collaborators.png")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/add-collaborator.png")
```

#### Step 3 {.unnumbered}

- Clone your repo to your local computer.

#### Step 4 {.unnumbered}

- Create an new **RMarkdown** or **Quarto** document locally with notes you take in class this week - maybe call it "notes.qmd" or "notes.Rmd"? - including at least some expository text written in **Markdown** and at least one ***R*** code block. If you make a ".qmd" document, I recommend unchecking "Use visual markdown editor", though that is your choice.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-Rmd.png")
```

... OR ...

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-qmd.png")
```

#### Step 5 {.unnumbered}

- Use `Render` (for ".qmd") or `Knit` (for ".Rmd") to publish your document as HTML.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/knit-Rmd.png")
```

... OR ...

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/render-qmd.png")
```

#### Step 6 {.unnumbered}

- Stage (or "add") and "commit" the changes to your repo locally and then "push" those up to ***GitHub***.

#### Step 7 {.unnumbered}

- Visit your repo on ***GitHub*** to confirm that you have done the above steps successfully.

#### Step 8 {.unnumbered}

- Submit the URL for your repo in **Canvas**

## Task 2: Begin with a local repo... {.unnumbered}

This is an alternative workflow to that described above, which also works well. It is outlined in more detail in [**Module 6**](#module-06) as "Option 3" under **Connecting a Local Repo to** ***GitHub***.

#### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

- From within ***RStudio***, create a new project called "exercise-2b" in a brand new directory also called "exercise-2b".

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-local-project.png")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/choose-project-type.png")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/exercise-2b.png")
```

> **NOTE** Be sure to check the box marked "Create a git repository" pressing the "Create Project" button.

#### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

- Configure a ***GitHub*** Personal Access Token (PAT) as described in [**Module 5**](#module-05) and [**Module 6**](#module-06), making sure that ***R*** and ***RStudio*** can access your cached credentials.

#### Step 3 {.unnumbered}

- As outlined in [**Module 6**](#module-06) **Method 3 Option 1**, open your project locally and run `usethis::use_github(protocol="https")` from the ***R*** console within your project's working directory.

#### Step 4 {.unnumbered}

- Answer the question about whether the suggested name for the remote repository is adequate and hit <Enter>.

This will create a new remote repository on ***GitHub***, add it as a `remote origin/main`, and open the ***GitHub*** page for the repository in your browser. Switch back to ***RStudio*** and continue with Steps 4 to 8 from above.
