# Data Wrangling {#module-10}

## Objectives

> The objective of this module to introduce you to data wrangling and transformation using the {dplyr} and {tidyr} packages, which are part of the {tidyverse} family.

## Preliminaries

- Install (but do not load yet) this package in ***R***: [{tidylog}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidylog/tidylog.pdf)
- Install and load this package: [{magrittr}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/magrittr.pdf)
- Load {tidyverse}
- Load in the KamilarAndCooper dataset we used in [**Module 09**](#module-09) as a "tibble" named **d**

```{r}
#| include: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-datasets/main/KamilarAndCooperData.csv"
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE) # creates a "tibble"
head(d)
```

## Data Wrangling Using {dplyr}

The {dplyr} package, included in the {tidyverse}, provides "a flexible grammar of data manipulation" that makes many of the manipulations that we explore in [**Module 07**](#module-07) and [**Module 09**](#module-09) much easier and much more intuitive!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "25%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr.png")
```

Among other functions, {dplyr} introduces a set of *verbs* (`filter()`, `select()`, `arrange()`, `rename()`, `mutate()`, `summarize()`, and `group_by()`) that can be used to perform useful operations on "tibbles" and related tabular data structures (e.g., normal data frames and data tables). Before using {dplyr} for summarizing data and producing aggregate statistics, let's look in general at what we can do with these verbs...

### `filter()` {.unnumbered}

The `filter()` function lets us pull out rows from a data frame that meet a particular criterion or set of criteria:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out_width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/filter.png")
```

::: {style="color:#787878; font-size: 14px;"}
<center>

FROM: Baumer et al. (2017). *Modern Data Science with R.* Chapman and Hall/CRC.

</center>

<br>
:::

```{r}
# selecting rows..
s <- filter(d, Family == "Hominidae" & Mass_Dimorphism > 2)
head(s)
```

> **NOTE:** The first argument of any of the {dplyr} verbs is the `.data` argument. That is the line of code above is equivalent to `s <- filter(.data = d, Family == "Hominidae" & Mass_Dimorphism > 2)`

### `select()` {.unnumbered}

The `select()` function lets us pull out only particular columns from a data frame:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out_width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/select.png")
```

::: {style="color:#787878; font-size: 14px;"}
<center>

FROM: Baumer et al. (2017). *Modern Data Science with R.* Chapman and Hall/CRC.

</center>

<br>
:::

```{r}
# selecting specific columns...
s <- select(d, Family, Genus, Body_mass_male_mean)
head(s)
```

### `arrange()` {.unnumbered}

The `arrange()` function lets us sort a data frame based on a select variable or set of variables:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out_width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/arrange.png")
```

::: {style="color:#787878; font-size: 14px;"}
<center>

FROM: Baumer et al. (2017). *Modern Data Science with R.* Chapman and Hall/CRC.

</center>

<br>
:::

```{r}
# reordering a data frame by a set of variables...
s <- arrange(d, Family, Genus, Body_mass_male_mean)
head(s)
```

We can also specify the direction in which we want the data frame to be sorted:

```{r}
# `desc()` can be used to reverse the order
s <- arrange(d, desc(Family), Genus, Species, desc(Body_mass_male_mean))
head(s)
```

### `rename()` {.unnumbered}

The `rename()` function allows us to change the names of particular columns in a data frame:

```{r}
# renaming columns...
s <- rename(d, "Female_Mass" = Body_mass_female_mean)
head(s$Female_Mass)
```

### `mutate()` {.unnumbered}

The `mutate()` function allows us to add new columns to a data frame:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out_width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/mutate.png")
```

::: {style="color:#787878; font-size: 14px;"}
<center>

FROM: Baumer et al. (2017). *Modern Data Science with R.* Chapman and Hall/CRC.

</center>

<br>
:::

```{r}
# and adding new columns...
s <- mutate(d, "Binomial" = paste(Genus, Species, sep = " "))
head(s$Binomial) # or head(s[["Binomial"]])
```

### `summarize()` and `group_by()` {.unnumbered}

The {dplyr} package makes it easy to summarize data using more convenient functions than the {base} function `aggregate()`, which we looked at in [**Module 09**](#module-09). The `summarize()` function specifies a list of summary variables that will appear in the output, along with the operations that will be performed on vectors in the data frame to produce those summary variables:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out_width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/summarize.png")
```

::: {style="color:#787878; font-size: 14px;"}
<center>

FROM: Baumer et al. (2017). *Modern Data Science with R.* Chapman and Hall/CRC.

</center>

<br>
:::

```{r}
# the n() function returns the number of rows in the data frame
s <- summarize(
  d,
  n_cases = n(),
  avgF = mean(Body_mass_female_mean, na.rm = TRUE),
  avgM = mean(Body_mass_male_mean, na.rm = TRUE)
)
s
```

Additionally, the `group_by()` function allows us to construct these summary variables for sets of observations defined by a particular categorical variable, as we did above with `aggregate()`.

```{r}
by_family <- group_by(d, Family)
# here, n() returns the number of rows in the group being considered
s <- summarise(
  by_family,
  n_cases = n(),
  avgF = mean(Body_mass_female_mean, na.rm = TRUE),
  avgM = mean(Body_mass_male_mean, na.rm = TRUE)
)
s
```

## Other Useful {dplyr} Functions

- `ungroup()` - clears group metadata from a table put in place `group_by()`
- `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()` - adds rows and columns, respectively, to a dataframe or tibble; when binding rows, if the column names do not match, the column will still be added and missing values filled with `NA`; when binding columns, the number of rows in each dataframe needs to be the same
- `pull()` - pulls a single variable out of a dataframe as a vector
- `sample_n()` - randomly samples a set of "size=" rows from a dataframe with ("replace=TRUE") or without ("replace=FALSE") replacement; this function is being superceded in favor of `slice_sample()`, where an additional argument (`n=` or `prop=`) allows you to specify the number or proportion of rows, respectively, to sample randomly
- `drop_na()` - drops rows from a dataframe that have `NA` values for any variable names passed as arguments to the function
- `rowwise()` - allows you to explicitly perform functions on a data frame on a row-at-a-time basis, which is useful if a vectorized function does not exit

A full list of {dplyr} functions and their descriptions is available [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html).

## Joining Tables

One of the other major forms of data wrangling that we often need to do is to **combine** variables from different tabular data structures into a new table. This process is often referred to as performing a "mutating join" or simply a "join".

> **NOTE:** For those with experience with other database systems, it is related to the "JOIN" commands in SQL.

The process works by matching observations in two different tables by a common key variable and then selecting additional variables of interest to pull from each of the tables. A simple example is the following... suppose we have two tables, one that contains average brain sizes for particular species of primates and one that contains individual body sizes for some of the same species, plus others. In the latter table, too, we may have data from multiple individuals of the same species represented.

```{r}
table1 <-
  tibble(
    Taxon = c("Gorilla", "Human", "Chimpanzee", "Orangutan", "Baboon"),
    Avg_Brain_Size = c(470, 1100, 350, 340, 140)
  )
table1
table2 <-
  tibble(
    Taxon = c(
      "Gorilla",
      "Gorilla",
      "Gorilla",
      "Human",
      "Human",
      "Chimpanzee",
      "Orangutan",
      "Orangutan",
      "Macaque",
      "Macaque",
      "Macaque"
    ),
    Body_Weight = c(80, 81, 77, 48, 49, 38, 37, 36, 6, 7, 6)
  )
table2
```

### Inner Joins {.unnumbered}

An *inner join* or *equijoin* matches up sets of observations between two tables whenever their keys are equal. The output of an inner join is a new data frame that contains all rows from the left-hand (*x*) and right-hand (*y*) tables where there are matching values in the key column, plus all columns from *x* and *y*. If there are multiple matches between the tables, all combination of the matches are returned. This is represented schematically below:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out_width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/inner_join.png")
```

</center>

<br>
:::

```{r}
inner_join(table1, table2, by="Taxon")
```

### Outer Joins {.unnumbered}

While an inner join keeps only observations that appear in both tables, different flavors of *outer joins* keep observations that appear in at least one of the tables. There are three types of outer joins:

- A *left join* returns all rows from the left-hand table, **x**, and all columns from **x** and **y**. Rows in **x** with no match in **y** will have `NA` values in the new columns from the **y** table. If there are multiple matches between **x** and \***y**, all combinations of the matches are returned.
- A *right join* returns all rows from the right-hand table, **y**, and all columns from **x** and **y**. Rows in **y** with no match in **x** will have `NA` values in the new columns from the **x** table. If there are multiple matches between **x** and **y**, all combinations of the matches are returned.
- A *full join* returns all rows and all columns in both the left-hand (**x**) and right-hand (**y**) tables, joining them where there are matches. Where there are not matching values, the join returns `NA` for the columns from table where they are missing.

The following figure shows a schematic representation of these various types of outer joins:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out_width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/outer_joins.png")
```

::: {style="color:#787878; font-size: 14px;"}
<center>

FROM: Wickham & Grolemund (2017). *R for Data Science.* O'Reilly Media, Inc.

</center>

<br>
:::

```{r}
left_join(table1, table2, by="Taxon")
right_join(table1, table2, by="Taxon")
full_join(table1, table2, by="Taxon")
```

### Other Joins {.unnumbered}

There are also two additional join types that may be sometimes be useful... note that these joins only return columns from the left-hand table, **x**.

- A *semi_join* returns rows from the left-hand table, **x**, where there are matching values in **y**, but keeping just the columns from **x**. A *semi_join* differs from an *inner_join* because an *inner_join* will return a row of *x* for every matching row of **y** (so some **x** rows can be duplicated), whereas a *semi_join* will never duplicate rows of **x**.
- An *anti_join* returns all rows from the left-hand table,**x** where there are not matching values in **y**, keeping just the columns from **x**.

```{r}
semi_join(table1, table2, by="Taxon")
anti_join(table1, table2, by="Taxon")
```

The cheatsheet on [Data Transformation with {dplyr}](cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf) provides a nice overview of these and additional data wrangling functions included the {dplyr} package.

## Chaining and Piping

One other cool thing about the {dplyr} package is that it provides a convenient way to chain together operations on a data frame using the "forward pipe" operator (`%>%`). The `%>%` operator basically takes what is on the left-hand side (LHS) of the operator and directly applies the function call on the right-hand side (RHS) of the operator to it. That is, it "pipes" what is on the LHS of the operator directly to the first argument of the function on the right. This process allows us to build of chains of successive operations, each one being applied to the outcome of the previous operation in the chain.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "25%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/pipe.png")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "25%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/MagrittePipe.jpg")
```

**EXAMPLE:**

```{r}
# this...
d %>% select(Scientific_Name, Body_mass_female_mean) %>% head()
# is equivalent to...
head(select(d,Scientific_Name, Body_mass_female_mean))
```

The forward pipe is useful because it allows us to write and follow code from left to right (as when writing in English), instead of right to left with many nested parentheses.

### CHALLENGE {.unnumbered}

- In **one line of code**, do the following:

    - Add a variable, **Binomial** to our data frame **d**, which is a concatenation of the **Genus** and **Species**...
    - Trim the data frame to only include the variables **Binomial**, **Family**, **Body_mass_female_mean**, **Body_mass_male_mean** and **Mass_Dimorphism**...
    - Group these variables by **Family**...
    - Calculate the average value for female body mass, male body mass, and mass dimorphism (remember, you will need to specify `na.rm = TRUE`...)
    - And arrange by *decreasing* average mass dimorphism.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show Code"
#| attr.output: '.details summary="Show Output"'
s <- mutate(d, Binomial = paste(Genus, Species, sep = " ")) %>%
  select(Binomial,
         Family,
         Body_mass_female_mean,
         Body_mass_male_mean,
         Mass_Dimorphism) %>%
  group_by(Family) %>%
  summarise(
    avgF = mean(Body_mass_female_mean, na.rm = TRUE),
    avgM = mean(Body_mass_male_mean, na.rm = TRUE),
    avgBMD = mean(Mass_Dimorphism, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avgBMD))
s
```

There are several other, very cool, "special case" pipe operators that are useful in particular situations. These are available from the {magrittr} package. [Actually, the functionality of the forward pipe operator also comes from the {magrittr} package, but it is replicated in {dplyr}.]

- The "tee" pipe (`%T>%`) allows you to pipe the outcome of a process into a new expression (just like the forward pipe operator does) *and* to simultaneously return the original value instead of the forward-piped result to an intermediate expression. This is useful, for example, for printing out or plotting intermediate results. In the example below, we filter our data frame for just observations of the genus *Alouatta*, print those to the screen as an intermediate side effect, and pass the filtered data to the `summarise()` function.

```{r}
s <- filter(d, Genus == "Alouatta") %T>% print() %>%
  summarise(avgF = mean(Body_mass_female_mean, na.rm = TRUE))
s
```

- The "assignment" pipe (`%<>%`) evaluates the expression on the right-hand side of the pipe operator and reassigns the resultant value to the left-hand side.

```{r}
s <- filter(d, Genus == "Alouatta")
s %<>% select(Genus, Species)
s
```

- Finally, the "exposition" pipe (`%$%`) exposes the names *within* the object on the left-hand side of the pipe to the right-hand side expression.

```{r}
s <- filter(d, Genus == "Alouatta") %$% paste0(Genus, " ", Species)
s 
```

## Dot Syntax and the Pipe

Normally, when we use the forward pipe operator, the LHS of the operator is passed to the first argument of the function on the RHS. Thus, the following are all equivalent:

```{r}
#| warning: false
s <- filter(d, Genus == "Alouatta")
s <- d %>% filter(Genus == "Alouatta")
d %>% filter(Genus == "Alouatta") -> s
```

The behavior of the forward pipe operator means we can use it do something like the following, where **d** is implicitly piped into the `data` argument for `ggplot()`

```{r}
#| warning: false
d %>% ggplot(aes(x=log(Body_mass_female_mean), y=log(Brain_Size_Species_Mean))) + geom_point()
```

We can also use dot (`.`) syntax with the {magrittr} forward pipe operator to pass the LHS of a statement to somewhere other than the first argument of the function on the RHS. Thus...

`y %>% function(x, .)` is equivalent to `function(x, y)`

... which means we can do something like this to pipe **d** into a function such as `lm()` ("linear model"), where the data frame that the function is run on is not the first argument: 

```{r}
d %>% lm(log(Body_mass_female_mean) ~ log(Brain_Size_Species_Mean), data = .)
```

We can also use the {magrittr} pipe's curly brace (`{}`) syntax to wrap the RHS of a statement and pass the LHS into several places:

```{r}
d %>% {plot(log(.$Brain_Size_Species_Mean), log(.$Body_mass_female_mean))}
```

> **NOTE:** ***R*** recently introduced a "native" pipe operator `|>` into its {base} syntax. It behaves very similarly to the {magrittr} forward pipe, but does not support dot syntax the same way. It also requires an explicit functions call on the RHS, which means appending `()` to the end of the function name, rather than just using the name. The first version of the line below using `%>%` could be used to take the log of all **Brain_Size_Female_Mean** values in **d**, while the second version, using `|>`, needs to have `()` appended to the functions calls to work properly.

```{r}
d %>% select(Brain_Size_Female_Mean) %>% log %>% head
d |> select(Brain_Size_Female_Mean) |> log() |> head()
```

## Useful Related Packages

The {tidylog} package provides wrappers around many {dplyr} and {tidyr} package functions that provide logged feedback on the outcome of those functions, which can be useful for understanding the effects of whatever data wrangling processes we run. For example, running `filter()` will provide feedback on the number of runs removed and kept as part of a filtering operation...

```{r}
library(tidylog)
# compare...
s <- dplyr::filter(d, Family == "Hominidae" & Mass_Dimorphism > 2)
# to...
s <- filter(d, Family == "Hominidae" & Mass_Dimorphism > 2)
```

Similarly, running `sample_n()` will give us logged output on that random record sampling process...

```{r}
# compare...
s <- dplyr::sample_n(d, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
# to...
s <- sample_n(d, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
detach(package:tidylog)
```

> **NOTE:** Loading in {tidylog} function will conflict with or "mask" corresponding function names from {dplyr} and {tidyr}. In the examples above, then, to run the {tidyverse} versions of `filter()` and `select_n()`, it was necessary to use the `::` notation to specifically call the {dplyr} version of the functions directly. The {tidylog} versions of these functions run a bit more slowly, so if speed is important, you may not want to use {tidylog}, you may want to call the {dplyr} or {tidyr} functions explicitly after loading {tidylog}, or you may want to simply call the {tidylog} version of a function explicitly.

```{r}
s <- tidylog::filter(d, Family == "Hominidae" & Mass_Dimorphism > 2)
```

```{r}
# | include: false
detach(package:magrittr)
detach(package:tidyverse)
```
